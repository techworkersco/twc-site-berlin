## Tech Workers Coalition Berlin - Learning Club
Learning is central to workers' empowerment. Without knowledge on the complex world we operate in, we are prey to the interests of those who capitalize on exploitation. Tech Worker Coalition organizes regular sessions in the form of reading groups to read and discuss articles, books and pamphlets about a variety of topics that sit on the boundary between technology critique, politics, philosophy and sociology. The role of the Tech Worker, the possible strategies and the history of worker organizations are also targets to our work.

## {{ page.date | date: '%A, %d %B %Y at %H:%M' }}
The topic proposed for this session by last month participants was: Stress. We propose a reading about how Capitalism in modern society invaded free time, breaking the boundary between work time and free time. This promiscuity prevents people to rest and be able to cope with stress as they used to in the past, in an increasingly unsustainable exploitation of human existence.

Reading:

From [The Refusal of Work](https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-refusal-of-work/), Chapter 3: The colonising power of Work 

## How to participate

The easiest way to participate is to just show up at the event having read the material for the given session.

If you want to have a more interactive experience though, we have a Slack group and a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1235638503299767/) in which we might publish some additional readings for the more passionate participants.
