On 30 September 2022, the Berlin Tech Workers Coalition will host a worker-led conference along with trade unions ver.di and IG metall, focused on engaging English speaking works council members and workplace activists across different tech, video gaming and rider companies. 

We will bring 50-100 people from 30-50 companies together for a day-long workshop (in Berlin) on sharing best organising practices for winning better workplace and living conditions. 

There will be interactive workshops, discussions, and the opportunity to activate workplaces to respond to increasing rent/inflation as well as common workplace issues like surveillance, algorithmic management and layoffs. 

The conference is open to all experience and engagement levels from beginners to experts.

Ideally, 2-4 colleagues per company would attend. If you have further questions or are interested in attending, you can get in touch with conf2022@techworkersberlin.com for more info.
