The Berlin Tech Workers Coalition will host the largest English speaking and tech worker-led conference in Germany, together with our trade unions [ver.di B+B](https://tech.verdi.de/) and [IG Metall Berlin](https://www.igmetall-berlin.de/english-info/news). 

Friday, 13 October is open for all [Works Council](https://techworkersberlin.com/works-councils) members (registration required). As a Works Council training per [BetrVG 37(6)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_betrvg/englisch_betrvg.html#p0229), you can do this training during working hours, and conference fee is paid by your employer. **Registration is mandatory**.

This is our second conference, [read about the first edition](https://techworkersberlin.com/events/tech-video-gaming-conference-in-berlin). Last year participants gathered at IG Metall's Berlin office, this year's conference will take place at ver.di's headquarter in Berlin.

![Group photo of Tech Workers Conference from last year](/assets/img/crowd_twc.jpg)

We are bringing 100+ English speaking tech workers from 50+ companies together for a two day conference in Berlin. Year round, we regularly network and stay in touch with each other. The conference is an opportunity to celebrate each others' milestones, successes and learnings over the year. 

There will be interactive workshops, discussions, and the opportunity to activate your workplaces. Topics include societal issues like rent, inflation, ecology and practical workplace issues like surveillance, gender pay gap, mass-layoffs and migrant organising.

The conference is open to tech workers of all experiences and engagement levels from beginners to expert. If you are interested in speaking/presenting on a specific topic, please get in touch with us, we have a few slots remaining!

If you have further questions or are interested in attending, you can get in touch with conference@techworkersberlin.com for further info.
