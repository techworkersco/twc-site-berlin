We are bringing 120 English speaking tech workers from 50+ companies together for a two day conference in Berlin. Year round, we regularly network and stay in touch with each other. The conference is an opportunity to celebrate each others' milestones, successes and learnings over the year. 

There will be interactive workshops, discussions, and the opportunity to activate your workplaces. Topics include societal issues like rent, inflation, ecology and practical workplace issues like surveillance, gender pay gap, mass-layoffs and migrant organising.

The conference is open to tech workers of all experiences and engagement levels from beginners to expert. If you are interested in speaking/presenting on a specific topic, please get in touch with us, we have a few slots remaining!

If you have further questions or are interested in attending, you can get in touch with conference@techworkersberlin.com for further info.
