🧚‍♂️ We cordially invite you to a reading group for the Berlin Tech Workers Coalition (TWC), where those organizing in the tech industry come together to build collective power beyond their individual workplaces.

💫Highlights: 

Our reading group meets to discuss topics related to tech topics. This time we are reading **More than a glitch - Confronting Race, Gender, and Ability Bias in Tech** by Meredith Broussard.

All people working in the tech industry are welcome. The event will be held in English.

The book explains different, specific forms of algorithmic harm through discriminatory bias of specific technologies, eventually connecting some of these effects to the personal story of the Author.

We will read and discuss the following sections:

* Intro
* Chapter 1 (Optional: useful if you have never read anything about algorithmic bias)
* Chapter 6, 7, 8, 9
