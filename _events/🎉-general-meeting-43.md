## 💫 Intro

Welcome! Our monthly General Meeting is your chance to get together with friendly, like-minded Berlin tech workers to talk about how to change the industry and build power – and then continue the discussion over some alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Whether this is your first or your forty-third meeting, we're looking forward to seeing you!

## 🗒️ Agenda

This one will be a more casual meet up, because it's summer and it would be great to have a little more fun at our meetings. Bring snacks or drinks if you want! We will still have dedicated time for people to discuss their organizing initiatives and get feedback from the group, and there will be a brief update on the TWC survey. To suggest additional agenda items, please message the meeting hosts on our Telegram group.
