  zero_covid:
    title: ZERO COVID
    summary:  We as TWC Berlin support the <a href="https://zero-covid.org/language/en/">ZeroCovid</a> campaign. Employers must take responsibility for the health and safety of workers and support working from home wherever possible. In all branches of industry where this is not possible and that are non-essential, a solidarity shutdown is urgently needed to fight the pandemic. If your employer fails to protect your health by adequate measures, or denies home office and you would like to discuss how we can support you, please contact us (also anonymously) on zero-covid@TechWorkersBerlin.com
