  summary: The tech industry is "disruptive", — including but not limited to gentrification, wage gaps, environmental pollution and militarism. But it does not have to be that way. The Berlin Tech Workers Coalition is a grassroots organization that empowers tech workers to build collective power and get involved in campaigns that make a positive impact on our society.

  zero_covid:
    title: ZERO COVID
    summary:  We as TWC Berlin support the <a href="https://zero-covid.org/language/en/">ZeroCovid</a> campaign. Employers must take responsibility for the health and safety of workers and support working from home wherever possible. In all branches of industry where this is not possible and that are non-essential, a solidarity shutdown is urgently needed to fight the pandemic. If your employer fails to protect your health by adequate measures, or denies home office and you would like to discuss how we can support you, please contact us (also anonymously) on zero-covid@techworkersberlin.com

If you live in Berlin and are eligible to vote, find out how to sign <a href="https://www.dwenteignen.de/unterschreiben/">here</a>.
