# Works Councils

As Tech Workers Coalition, we support the formation of Works Councils (Betriebsräte) as a means to organize and gain collective power within your workplace. Below is some basic information on the German system of Works Councils. If you'd like to learn more or have plans to initiate a campaign at your workplace, please get in touch or join us in our next general meeting. Please be aware that this it not legal advice.

## Training

We host Works Council trainings regularly, including an introduction to the German Works Council and trade union structures and the possibility to discuss strategic questions and formal considerations of a Works Council campaign. We provide an open forum and safe space to share experiences and learn from each other.

## Articles

Below we collect articles on Works Council activities in Berlin tech companies. In an interview series, we present perspectives and experiences from Works Councillors. If you are a Works Councillor yourself, or know a fellow worker who is, and would be interested taking part, we'd love to hear from you: [content@techworkersberlin.com](mailto:content@techworkersberlin.com).
